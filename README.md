# Keyboard Warrior

Typing practice displays a word which you must then type within a specific interval of time. If the word is incorrectly typed it stays on screen and the time interval remains the same. But when the word is correctly typed a new word is displayed and the time interval is slightly reduced.

This project is based off of [app-ideas/typing-practice](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/2-Intermediate/Typing-Practice-App.md) project requirements.
